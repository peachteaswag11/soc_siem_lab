# Shreyas SOC SIEM Lab

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I set up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab as a student using [Splunk/Wazuh].  
The goal is to ingest logs from Windows (Sysmon) and network captures (Wireshark), then build dashboards and detection rules.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Windows VM + Sysmon
- Wireshark
- Splunk (Free) or Wazuh
- Filebeat/Winlogbeat

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and forward endpoint + network logs
- Build dashboards for authentication, process creation, and network traffic
- Create 5+ detection rules for common attack scenarios

## 📝 Deliverables
- SIEM dashboards (screenshots in /screenshots folder)
- Detection rules and queries
- Config files
- Blog article link: [Coming Soon]

## 🚀 How to Reproduce
1. Install Sysmon on Windows VM  
2. Configure log forwarding with Filebeat/Winlogbeat  
3. Ingest into Splunk/Wazuh  
4. Import provided dashboards
